    :one => "In 1765, the organization 'Daughters of Liberty' was Formed.  Daughters of Liberty was a group of women that was formed in 1765 during the American Revolution.  Their goal was to boycott British goods and create them themselves.  For example, they commonly weaved homespun cotton, which was an act of defiance in the American Revolution due to the fact that they were imported by Britain.  They also helped in the war by making uniforms, blankets, and ammunition.  Lastly, they raised over $300,000 that greatly aided the Revolutionaries in winning the war" ,
    :two => "On April 26, 1777, Sybil Ludington, also known as “The Female Paul Revere,” volunteered to rouse the militia during a British attack.  She started at 9:00 pm and rode on a 40 mile trail around Putnam County, waking and gathering militiamen, all while avoiding British Bandits.  After her ride, the militia was able to march towards Danbury, Connecticut the town being attacked by the British, and were able to push the British all the way back to the Long Island Sound." ,
    :three =>"On October 5, 1789, the women’s bread march in occurred in France.  A group of angry, starving women marched on Versailles chanting for bread.  They eventually broke into the palace of Versailles and attempted to kill Marie Antoinette, but she escaped to Louis XVI’s room through a secret passageway.  Once there, she convinced Louis XVI to address the crowds.  Louis XVI agreed, and announced that he would listen to the crowds and move to France.  The next day, the king and queen were captured, bringing an end to the rule of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette.  Although it is significant that this march brought an end to monarchy in France, some argue that the change in the roles of women were even more substantial.  This allowed women to gain a lot more power and influence in the National Assembly, and started a movement for gender equality across France.",
    :four => "On September 5, 1791, the Declaration of Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen was written.  The declaration was a document stating that women are equal to men and should have the same rights as men.  This was one of many direct threats to male authority in the French Revolution.  Although the declaration was never passed, and the author, Olympe De Gouges, was charged and executed for attacking the regime of Maximilien Robespierre, it still represented a turning point for women’s rights in the French Revolution.",
    :five => "On March 6, 1793, Pauline Leon’s petition asking for women to have the right to bear arms was delivered to the national assembly.  Leon was a feminist and supporter of women’s rights during the French revolution.  Pauline Leon is most famous because she wrote a petition signed by over 300 women to the National Assembly, asking for women to be given to bear arms.  Although it was denied, it forced extensive debate in France about women’s rights.",
    :six => "On July 9, 1793, Claire Lacombe and Pauline Leon founded the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women.  It was a very popular group that vouched for stricter price control and to drive out food hoarded.  Although it only lasted about 5 months due the banning of all women’s clubs by Jacobins, it was one of the first major issues that forced debate about women’s rights.",
    :seven => "On October 5, 1802, Sanite Bélair was sentenced to her death after years of fighting in the Haitian Revolution.  She was one of few women to fight in the revolution, and it is believed that Sanité and her husband, Charles Belair, were responsible for the revolt of almost the entire slave population of L’Artibonite.  As she was about to be executed, she shouted at the other slaves that were captured ‘Viv Libète anba esklavaj!’ which translates to, ‘Liberty! No to Slavery!’  Lastly, in 2004, Bélair was featured on the 10 Gourde Banknote, and was also declared a national Heroine by the Haitian government.",
    :eight => "On May 18, 1803, Catherine Flon finished making the Haitian Flag, a task given to her by her godfather.  In addition, the design that Flon created is still used on the Haitian Flag today.  It is said that Flon created the flag by taking the French flag and ripping the white part out, then turning the flag sideways.  Also, she was featured on the 10 Gourde Banknotes that were issued in the year 2000, and is celebrated annually in Haiti during Flag Day.",
    :nine => "In 1815, Salavarrieta Ríos fought for Latin American Independence.  Ríos was a spy for the Patriot guerrilla forces, a group that fought against the Spanish.  She worked undercover for the Patriots for one year, where she gathered intelligence on the Spanish army.  She is also considered to be a good person, and it is thought that she snuck into prisons that held captured soldiers, and gave them food and updates on the current situation.  But, in 1816 she was discovered and captured, and was executed on November 14, 1817.  She now has a statue for her contribution to the revolution in Bogotá, Columbia, and is remembered as the heroine of Latin American Independence.",
    :ten => "On August 7, 1819, The Battle of Boyacá took place.  The Battle of Boyacá is the most famous battle that took place during the Latin American Revolution.  During it, Bolívar’s forced defeated royalist forces led by spanish colonels.  It was eventually discovered that women played a major role in this battle by fighting the Spanish.  In addition, Evangelista Tamayo achieved the rank of captain during this battle, and women were a major reason that Bolívar’s forces were able to defeat the Spanish."
